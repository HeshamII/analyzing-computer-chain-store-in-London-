Itâ€™s about analyzing computer chain store in London and we have 15 stores within the city and answering some business questions to increase sales . 
The first task is to find the total sales for each store over the entire year ,did it by exporting the data about sales for each store and merged them using SQL it can be more easier so, I was created a new table which contains Store_Postcode and using the sum function to calculate the Retail_Price for each store over the entire year at the end visualizing it by proc SGPLOT.
The second task and the most challenging part of the project is to figure out the geographical in which area to mail our marketing materials . Mailing marketing materials is expensive and we'd like to mail only to those who live close to the stores, that's to find out how far people usually travel to buy computers in London. I derived new columns from the existing ones to make the data tidy and create a variety of options to compare and get more useful insights.
